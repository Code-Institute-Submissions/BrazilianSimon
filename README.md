## Design Choices 🎨
This is a game with the theme inspired in Brazil, so I think in use the colours of the flag of Brazil also some images of green leafs everything to give a good user experience.

#### Fonts:
I chose to use the font **[Luckiest Guy](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Luckiest+Guy)** because it is a funny font and I think it matches with the game.🎮🕹

#### Colours:
This Game🎮 was inspired in the flag of Brazil so I used the three colours plus white. 

- **'Green Pigment'** #009c3b:  This colour symbolizes the Brazilian forests.
- **'Golden Yellow'** #FFDF00: symbolizes the country's riches.
- **'St Patricks Blue'** #002776: symbolizes the Brazilian sky and rivers.
- **'White'** #FFFFFF: means the desire for peace.

#### Background:
The image that is fixed in the website's background was taken from [FreePik](https://www.freepik.com/). I manually resized the image using a tool called [PhotoPea](https://www.photopea.com/), having accurately sized images reduces the load time of the website.
