  ## UX (User Experience)
### Project goals
The objective of this project is develop a new version of an old game Simon with the flag of Brazil. The user will have a great experience. With this I will show my skills in **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **JavaScript**. Also in the framework **Bootstrap** and library **jQuery**.

### User Goals
- A website with a great user experience.
- A website visually appealing.
- Responsive, it should work on desktops, tablets and mobile phones.

### Site's Owner Goals:
- A game with a nice design and responsiveness.
- A easy game that a kid can play and have fun.
- a colorful game with a great user experience.

### User Stories:
- "As an user, I expect a game intuitive."
- "As an user, I expect this game to be easy to play."  
- "As an user, I want a game to interact with."  
- "As an user, I want a game with an enjoyable experience."  

## Design Choices 🎨
This is a game with the theme inspired in Brazil, so I think in use the colours of the flag of Brazil also some images of green leafs everything to give a good user experience.

#### Fonts:
I chose to use the font **[Luckiest Guy](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Luckiest+Guy)** because it is a funny font and I think it matches with the game.🎮🕹

#### Colours:
This Game🎮 was inspired in the flag of Brazil so I used the three colours plus white. 

- **'Green Pigment'** #009c3b:  This colour symbolizes the Brazilian forests.
- **'Golden Yellow'** #FFDF00: symbolizes the country's riches.
- **'St Patricks Blue'** #002776: symbolizes the Brazilian sky and rivers.
- **'White'** #FFFFFF: means the desire for peace.

#### Background:
The image that is fixed in the website's background was taken from [FreePik](https://www.freepik.com/). I manually resized the image using a tool called [PhotoPea](https://www.photopea.com/), having accurately sized images reduces the load time of the website.

## Wireframes: 🔧
For this project, I created wireframes using [Balsamiq Mockups](https://balsamiq.cloud/) and [Proto Prototypes](https://proto.io/). I started by creating some basics wireframes for desktop/mobile on Balsamiq just to have an idea. After that, I built a prototype with more styling.

## Features:
- Easy navigation.
- Trendy, intuitive design and user experience.
- User interaction.

## Planning: 📐
I will follow the Wireframes that I created in order to get what was thought previously. I am also planning to create two columns beside the flag one on the right and another on the left, those columns will disappear in the mobile version. Doing some tests is part of the plan as well.
