  ## UX (User Experience)
### Project goals
The objective of this project is develop a new version of an old game Simon with the flag of Brazil. The user will have a great experience. With this I will show my skills in **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **JavaScript**. Also in the framework **Bootstrap** and library **jQuery**.

### User Goals
- A website with a great user experience.
- A website visually appealing.
- Responsive, it should work on desktops, tablets and mobile phones.

### Site's Owner Goals:
- A game with a nice design and responsiveness.
- A easy game that a kid can play and have fun.
- a colorful game with a great user experience.

### User Stories:
- "As an user, I expect a game intuitive."
- "As an user, I expect this game to be easy to play."  
- "As an user, I want a game to interact with."  
- "As an user, I want a game with an enjoyable experience."  

## Design Choices 🎨
This is a game with the theme inspired in Brazil, so I think in use the colours of the flag of Brazil also some images of green leafs everything to give a good user experience.

#### Fonts:
I chose to use the font **[Luckiest Guy](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Luckiest+Guy)** because it is a funny font and I think it matches with the game.🎮🕹

#### Colours:
This Game🎮 was inspired in the flag of Brazil so I used the three colours plus white. 

- **'Green Pigment'** #009c3b:  This colour symbolizes the Brazilian forests.
- **'Golden Yellow'** #FFDF00: symbolizes the country's riches.
- **'St Patricks Blue'** #002776: symbolizes the Brazilian sky and rivers.
- **'White'** #FFFFFF: means the desire for peace.

#### Background:
The image that is fixed in the website's background was taken from [FreePik](https://www.freepik.com/). I manually resized the image using a tool called [PhotoPea](https://www.photopea.com/), having accurately sized images reduces the load time of the website.

## Wireframes: 🔧
For this project, I created wireframes using [Balsamiq Mockups](https://balsamiq.cloud/) and [Proto Prototypes](https://proto.io/). I started by creating some basics wireframes for desktop/mobile on Balsamiq just to have an idea. After that, I built a prototype with more styling.
