Welcome to my project **Brazilian Simon**. This is a new version of the superb game **Simon**, Simon was invented in 1978 by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, this is a electronic game of memory skill. I am Brazilian so I created a version of Simon in the flag of Brazil. I hope you enjoy it. 

Happy Code! 👨‍💻 Happy days!
